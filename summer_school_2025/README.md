# Hi! PARIS Summer School 2025 - Exploring Machine Learning Deployment from beginner to advanced level ðŸš€

![Alt text](images/hi-paris.png)

This repository contains the demos for the **Hi! PARIS Summer School 2025** session on **Exploring Machine Learning Deployment from beginner to advanced level** ðŸš€.

The repository is divided into three folders, one for each practical demo:
- `streamlit-app/` for the Streamlit demo
- `sagemaker-deployment/` for the AWS SageMaker demo
- `docker-app/` for the Docker + AWS Lambda demo 

This repository was originally created by LaurÃ¨ne David for the [Hi! PARIS Summer School 2024](https://github.com/laudavid/ss2024_deploy_app). 
<br>

The session will be hosted by  **Awais SANI**, Senior Machine Learning engineer @ Hi! PARIS and **Marguerite LEANG**, Machine Learning engineer @ Hi! PARIS.

## Demo 1: Deploy a Sentiment Analysis app using Streamlit 

![Alt text](images/app_demo.PNG)



### <u>1. Streamlit tutorials</u>
- Deploy a Streamlit app: https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app
- Manage streamlit secrets: https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app/secrets-management
- Connect app to external data sources: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/databases
- Deploy an app to HuggingFace spaces: https://medium.com/@imanuelyosi/deploy-your-streamlit-web-app-using-hugging-face-7b9cddb11148
<br>

### <u>2. Terminal commands</u>
Install a virtual environment with `python 3.10` (ensure you have installed `anaconda3`):
```python
conda create --name venv_streamlit python=3.10
```

Activate the virtual environment:
```python
conda activate venv_streamlit
```

Install the packages in the `requirements.txt` in `streamlit-app/`:
```bash
pip install -r streamlit-app/requirements.txt
````

Launch the streamlit app locally <br>
```python 
streamlit run streamlit-app/app.py
```
<br>

Build a `requirements.txt` file to deploy the app via Streamlit Cloud
```python
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```
<br>
<br>

## Demo 2: Deploy pre-trained sklearn models with AWS SageMaker 


### <u>1. How to launch a SageMaker notebook instance</u> 

#### Step 1: Create an AWS account
First, you will need to create an AWS account if you don't already have one. <br>
https://aws.amazon.com/?nc1=h_ls

#### Step 2: Go to the Amazon SageMaker AI console and create a notebook instance.

Go to the `Amazon SageMaker AI` console and select the `Notebooks` option on the console's left tab.
To create the notebook, click on **Create notebook instance**.

#### Step 3: Configure the SageMaker notebook instance.

- Select a *notebook instance name*
- Select a *notebook instance type* 
- Select a *platform type* for the notebook instance, for example the JupyterLab version you want to use
- For the IAM role, click on *Create a new role option* then create a role associed to the instance's S3 bucket.

Most of these configuration can be left with their default value. Only the creation of a new IAM role is mandatory to access the S3 bucket.

In the *Additional configuration* part, you can modify the volume size (in GB) of the notebook instance if needed.

#### Step 4: Launch the notebook instance 
Once you've provided all the required information, you can now launch the notebook (this can take a couple of minutes). To stop the instance from running, click on the notebook instance then select *Stop*. This will be prevent additional costs.
